        git config --global user.name "Susmitha"
        git config --global user.email "susmithakamu1@gmail.com"
step 3: git status (See status of file such as no commits means files are being untraked)

step 6: git branch (Whenever we create repository default branch is "Main" branch)
step 7: git branch -M main (Rename branch from master to main)
step 8: git remote add origin https://github.com/susmitha-shinney/gittutorials.git (Take from repository)
step 9: git status (To confirm files are being tracked)
step 10: git remote -v (To know the origins such fetch(from where it is fetching)and push(To which path it is placing)
step 11: git push origin main (Pushing the files from staging environment to github "Main" Repository)
step 12: git restore filename(README.md) (It helps to store the changes in the file which is present in Staging environment)
